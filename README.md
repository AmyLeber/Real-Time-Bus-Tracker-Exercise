# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker-Exercise
This is the Real Time Bus Tracking Exercise for MIT's Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN course.  This tracker shows the stops for the  #1 bus that travels from MIT's campus to Harvard's campus.

Open the HTML file to view the webpage.  you will see the dot (the bus) moving on the page.

I would like to change the city of the targeted bus to Philadelphia or perhaps Harrisburg, PA.
